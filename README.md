## üéØ BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT

NutriEats faces critical challenges that require data-driven solutions:

### 1. CUSTOMER RATINGS & RETENTION
**Problem:** Meals with high nutritional value sometimes receive low ratings, while average meals are loved.
**Goal:** Identify the hidden drivers of **customer satisfaction** beyond simple nutritional metrics.

### 2. OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCY
**Problem:** Highly variable preparation and cook times create kitchen bottlenecks and slow down delivery.
**Goal:** Pinpoint **time-inefficient meals and cooking methods** to streamline kitchen workflows.

### 3. HEALTH POSITIONING VS. REALITY
**Problem:** Meals tagged internally as "healthy" may not align with objective nutrition standards (e.g., high sugar/sodium).
**Goal:** Evaluate which meals are **truly healthy** and require reformulation or relabeling.

### 4. MENU OPTIMIZATION
**Problem:** The vast menu needs strategic prioritization to boost both profitability and satisfaction.
**Goal:** Gain insights into which cuisines, diet types, and cooking methods should be **prioritized for expansion or retired**.
